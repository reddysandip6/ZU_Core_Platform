# ZU Core Platform 🔒

**Decentralized AI Control Protocol (ZU)**  
A global framework for responsible AI behavior, governance, and identity-free access.

## 🔧 Architecture

C → Token + Reputation Engine  
B → ZU Core Protocol (1, 2, 3)  
A → Sentinel AI Oversight

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Anonymous AI Tokens**: Behavior-driven access without requiring traditional IDs.
- **Reputation Engine**: Tracks AI/human performance & risk.
- **Sentinel Layer**: Independent watchdog to govern AI rules & violations.
- **Web UI**: Governance dashboard for usage, logs & trust metrics.
